# Technical Assessment

Please create Javscript functions that accept input parameters to perform each of the following:

1. An integer number A is given.
Check if the number A is greater than 120.
Print the report.

2. Calculate the value F(x)
F(X) = 10x^4 -8,  for x > 10
F(X) = 1000, for x = 10
F(X) = 100 - 1/(10+2x), for x < 10

3. A three-digit integer number is given.
What is the greatest digit?

4. A 4-digit integer number is given
Make the number that is inverse order of the digits.

In example given is 1234 the output is 4321.

5. Given are integer numbers X an N.
Calculate Y = 10 + X/2 + 2/(3X) + 3X/4 + 4/(5X) + .....
Y have N members.

6. Given is integer positive number A, and A numbers of D.
Check if numbers are in nondecreasing order.

7. Given is integer number A.
How many digits are 9?

8. Given is integer positive number A.
Create first 5 prime numbers greater from A.

9. Given is interval (B, C) print all successive prime number from given interval.

10. Given are arrays A(I) of K elements and X(J) of K elements.
Array elements A(I) which are not greater from elements of array X(J) sort in nondecreasing order.
Do not use helper array.
In example
A(I) = [2,100,17,120,35,66,1,3,2,100]
X(J) = [300,18,130,122,100]

Result:
A(I) = [1,2,2,3,17]

11. Given is array B(K) of L elements.
Check if all array elements B(K) not negative numbers.

12. British and French students took the same math test.
The tests results - points are put in arrays B(J) from S elements (British) and F(K) from D elements (French).
Print combined tests (British and French) results sorted by success.
Do not use helper array.

13. Given is array A(I) of R elements.
And given is array D(L) of N elements.
Insert array D(L) to array A(I) after greatest element of array A(I).
Do not use helper array and built-in functions.

14. Given is array X(I) of N elements.
And array A(J) of K elements.
Insert array A(J) in to array X(I) before least element of array X(I).
Do not use helper array and built-in functions.

15. Given is array X(I) from N elements and integer positive number K.
Rotate elements of array for K elements to the left.
Do not use built-in functions.

16. Given are integer positive numbers A and B.
Create and print array A(I) from all Fibonacci numbers who belongs to the interval (A,B).

17. Given is array X(I) from N elements.
On which position is the first element smaller than the largest element of the array?

18. Given is array A(I) from N elements.
And array B(K) from N elements.
Create a new array which will first contain elements of the array A(I) with odd position, and then elements of the array B(K)  with even position.

19. Given is martix M(I,J) with dimenzions 2N*2K.
Swap 1st and 3rd row.
Swap 2nd and 4th row.
Swap 5th and 7th row.
...
and so on until end.

20. Given are integer positive numbers n and A
Calculate:
B = nA+ (n-1)A^2+(n-2)A^3+....+A^n

21. Given are integer positive numbers A and K

C = a!/2! + (a+2)!/3! + (a+4)!/4! +....
C have K members.

22. Given is integer positive number N and quadratic matrix A(I,J) with dimension N*N.
Create array which first contains elements of the main diagonal and then elements of antidiagonal.

23. Given is integer positive number N and quadratic matrix B(I,J) with dimension N*N.
Compute and print product of elements of triangle bellow main diagonal and sum of elements of triangle above main diagonal.

24. Given is integer positive number N and quadratic matrix C(I,J) with dimension N*N.
Mirror swap content of triangle above antidiagonal with triangle bellow antidiagonal.
